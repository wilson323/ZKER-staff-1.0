# Better Harnesses, Smaller Models: Building 90% Cheaper Agents via Automated Harness Adaptation

This repository contains the replication package for the paper result table and figures. 

## Download Artifacts

The large replication artifacts are hosted on figshare:

```text
https://figshare.com/s/520e6259e3cc730c358d
```

Download these files into the repository root:

```text
migration_analysis_figshare_core.zip
migration_analysis_run_eval_artifacts.zip
```

If a checksum file is provided, download it into the repository root and verify
the archives:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

The compact archive is sufficient to rerender the paper table and figures. The
run/eval archive is only needed to recompute `summary.json`,
`selected_test_rows.json`, and `tableau_data.json` from the curated
`run.json`/`eval_results.yaml` files.

## Quick Rerun

1. Decompress the compact archive.

```bash
unzip migration_analysis_figshare_core.zip
```

2. Recreate the table and figures from the included intermediate data.

```bash
uv run --project replication_package python replication_package/scripts/render_from_intermediates.py
```

3. Inspect the regenerated outputs.

```

## Run/Eval Rerun

Use this path to recompute `summary.json`, `selected_test_rows.json`, and
`tableau_data.json` from the curated `run.json` and `eval_results.yaml` files.
The curated run list is stored in
`replication_package/data/curated_run_eval_inputs.json`.

1. Decompress both archives.

```bash
unzip migration_analysis_figshare_core.zip
unzip migration_analysis_run_eval_artifacts.zip
```

2. Recompute the run-level summary.

```bash
uv run --project replication_package python replication_package/scripts/collect_run_data.py
```

3. Recompute the selected rows and table/figure input data.

```bash
uv run --project replication_package python replication_package/scripts/derive_tableau_data.py
uv run --project replication_package python replication_package/scripts/build_triplet_coverage.py
```

4. Regenerate the final table and figures.

```bash
uv run --project replication_package python replication_package/scripts/render_from_intermediates.py
```

The run/eval archive contains the files needed to recompute the table inputs. It
does not include raw trace files, so the diversity figure uses the included
`task_diversity_metrics.json`.

## Run One Experiment From Raw Data

The committed root `data/*.json` files are the task datasets. The experiment
runner reads the task's `tasks/<task_id>/run*.yaml` config, which points to the
corresponding raw data file through `data_path`.

Most datasets are self-contained, for RefactorBench, clone [the source repo](https://github.com/microsoft/RefactorBench) and point the data file to the cloned path. 
For WebArena, first set up environment following the instructions in [webarena-verified](https://github.com/ServiceNow/webarena-verified).
For other tasks, set up environment following the custom build of [LOCA-bench](https://github.com/malusamayo/LOCA-bench).

Example: run a small baseline experiment on `data/machine_operating_s2l.json`.

1. Prepare and launch one baseline run.

```bash
uv run python run.py run-baseline \
  --manifest - \
  --batch-dir generated/baseline_batches/example_machine_operating \
  --yes <<'EOF'
task_id	model_name	max_examples	n_responses
machine_operating_s2l	gemma-4-26b-a4b	10	1
EOF
```

2. Inspect the generated batch metadata and outputs.

```text
generated/baseline_batches/example_machine_operating/batch.json
generated/baseline_batches/example_machine_operating/configs/
generated/baseline_batches/example_machine_operating/logs/
results/machine_operating_s2l/gemma-4-26b-a4b_default/rollouts/baseline/
```

For paper-scale baseline runs, use `max_examples=100` and `n_responses=3`
for 100-example tasks. WebArena uses 50 examples in this package. The task
server Docker image and model/API credentials must be available before launching
new experiments.

Example: run a small GEPA optimization on the same raw task data.

1. Prepare and launch one optimization run.

```bash
uv run python run.py run \
  --manifest - \
  --batch-dir generated/gepa_batches/example_machine_operating \
  --max-parallel 1 \
  --yes <<'EOF'
Task	task_lm	N	budget ($)	use_adaptation	reflection_lm	num_exploration	seed
machine_operating_s2l	gemma-4-26b-a4b	10	2	TRUE	gemini-3.1-pro-preview	1	0
EOF
```

2. Inspect the generated optimization metadata and outputs.

```text
generated/gepa_batches/example_machine_operating/batch.json
generated/gepa_batches/example_machine_operating/configs/
generated/gepa_batches/example_machine_operating/logs/
results/machine_operating_s2l/gemma-4-26b-a4b_default/gepa/seed0/
results/machine_operating_s2l/gemma-4-26b-a4b_default/rollouts/gepa_seed0_best_best_config/
```

The optimization command first runs GEPA on the train/validation split, then
runs the selected best harness on the full task dataset. For paper-scale
optimization, use the task/model/seed rows listed in
`replication_package/outputs/data/included_task_model_seed_triplets.csv`, with
the full training budget used by the paper rather than the small `budget ($)=2`
smoke-test value above.
